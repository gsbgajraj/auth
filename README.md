## Project Details

This project is tailored for beginners. We'll be developing a task management application (todo app) together. Users will be able to register an account by providing their name, email, and password. Once logged in, they can create, check off, and delete tasks. Additionally, users will have the option to update their profile within the app.

It is a simple app. In the project we didn't focus on styles, so the ui is simple.
